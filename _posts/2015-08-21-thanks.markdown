Finally, the Google Summer of Code 2015 concluded. 
Over 1,000 students - including myself - used the summer to develop amazing open-source software, making our daily life better.

DNSSEC for minidns
------------------
I successfully finished my project, to include support DNSSEC in minidns, a popular DNS client library for Java with support for Android.
Just to summarize my previous posts, here is a list of things developed during the summer:

- Parsing the wire format of various DNS records: DLV, DNSKEY, DS, NSEC, NSEC3, NSEC3PARAM, RRSIG, OPENPGPKEY, OPT, TLSA
- Creating the wire format for all supported DNS records (required for proper validation)
- Recursive resolving from the DNS root servers
- Validating signatures (RRSIG) using RSA and DSA keys and MD5 (deprecated), SHA1, SHA-256 and SHA-512 hashes
- Validating negative results using NSEC and NSEC3
- Validating delegation using direct domain chain (DS) or DNSSEC lookaside validation (DLV)
- Certificate validation using TLSA records (DANE)
- Include DNSSEC resolving and DANE capabilities as optional features into smack

To ensure correctness of all features, I also added a lot of unit tests to minidns. Due to this I was able to find some relevant bugs in minidns.
Unfortunately, some of the optionally desired features did not make it into usable state until today. I will further work on adding the following after this years GSoC:

- Validate signatures using ECDSA keys
- Include DNSSEC resolving, DANE capabilities and OPENPGPKEY DNS record support into OpenKeychain

Thanks
