Next monday is the soft pencils down date and the firm pencils down is scheduled for next friday.

I completed the support for DANE and did further testing. With DANE support being added, 
we can finally start adding DNSSEC and DANE to applications. Hooray.

The list of open TODOs:

- ECDSA support
- DNSSEC look-aside validation (DLV)
- Integration with smack and OpenKeychain
- Moar Tests (can we reach 90% test coverage?)
- Documentation

Hopefully the first three points will be finished until monday,
allowing me to focus on tests on documentation the last four days (as suggested by Google).
